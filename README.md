# TenderSense  
### Smart Tender & RFP Intelligence Platform

TenderSense is a web-based platform designed to **simplify, speed up, and improve** the way organizations discover, analyze, and respond to tenders and RFPs (Request for Proposals).

Instead of manually scanning portals, reading long documents, and matching requirements line by line, TenderSense brings everything together in one intelligent workflow — saving time and improving response quality.

## 🧩 The Problem We Are Solving

Tender and RFP management is still largely manual for many organizations:

- Teams spend **hours browsing multiple tender portals**
- Requirement documents are **lengthy and difficult to analyze**
- Spec matching is often **manual and error-prone**
- Proposal preparation is **repetitive and time-consuming**
- Important opportunities are **missed due to late discovery**

These inefficiencies directly affect win rates, team productivity, and business growth.
